<h2>Introduction</h2>

    Hey guys, my name is Alex, i am 25 years old and currently a 4th year computer science student here at lewis,

    Previously i was a professional call of duty player!
    I just returned back from a year and a half study abroad in japan learning japanese! 
    I have 1 brother 1 sister and a pitbull boxer named rose.

<h2>My favorite hoby / activity </h2>
    <pre>
    Currently in my free time i play video games with friends, if i have a lot
    of free time i like to go golfing!. For games i usually just play FPS games 
    like valorant or CSGO, but i played call of duty professionally on the PS4.
    Another hobby would be trying to learn languages, i just started out so i 
    have only learned japanese but would love to learn korean or chinese as well.

<h2> Fun Fact</h2>     
    <pre>
    Honestly i don't think theres any one thing about me thats unique but 
    when you add all my experiences together it makes me unique in some way.
    tons of people have played games professionally or studied abroad, but i'd 
    like to think not many have done both!
